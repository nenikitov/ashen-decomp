# Ashen source port

A playable source port of an obscure NGage game Ashen

## How to run?

- Place the ROM
    ```sh
    mkdir ./rom/
    cp /path/to/packfile.dat ./rom/packfile.dat
    ```
- Parse files (output will be in `output/parsed/`)
    ```sh
    cargo test --release -- --ignored parse_rom_packfile
    cargo test --release -- --ignored parse_rom_asset
    ```

## File structure

### Overview

- File is composed out of 3 parts
    - Header
    - File declarations
    - Data
- Some data is compressed using `zlib` algorithm, some isn't
- All data is stored in Little-endian

### Header

| Size (bytes) | Purpose          |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| `4`          | Signature `PMAN` |
| `4`          | Number of files  |
| `56`         | Copyright        |

### File declarations

- This structure is repeated for every file in the packfile

| Size (bytes) | Purpose                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `4`          | Padding? Always `00 00 00 00`  |
| `4`          | Offset of the file in packfile |
| `4`          | Size of the file               |
| `4`          | Padding? Always `00 00 00 00`  |

### Data

- If data is compressed using zlib

| Size (bytes) | Purpose                |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| `2`          | Signature `ZL`         |
| `3`          | Size when uncompressed |
| `*`          | Zlib stream            |

- If data is not compressed, just data stream

### Known file declarations

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è**

I use the packfile that comes with Ashen 1.06.
Your packfile may have different offsets to files, I didn't test with different versions.

Notes:
- **‚ö†Ô∏è** - Unknown file
- **üîé** - Unseen content

### Known file formats

### Text bank

- Starts with `9B 01 00 00`
- The rest is encoded in UTF16
- All text chunks are separated with `\r\r`
- There are weird characters like `20 20` which are probably to control in-game scripts

### Color palette

- Is a collection of 4 byte integers
- Every integer is the 12-bit color
- If transformed into 256x32 image, shows colored arcs similar to the Quake color palette

### Entity

- Groups texture, model, and possibly animation data together
- Textures are stored as 8 bit integers that are indeces of the color on the color palette

### Music

- Another collection of Zlib files concatinated together
- Music is probably stored as OGG, instruments separate from composition
- **TODO** Document this better
- Segments -> files
- 1st segment - OST
    - 7
    - 1
    - 8
    - 3
    - 5
    - 4
    - 2
    - 7
    - victory
    - concept
    - death
    - load
    - main menu

## Discoveries

- Test level for enemies
    - There is a pool with fish enemies, which I don't remember seeing in the game
- Test level ???
    - Collision by itself works with other level geometry, geometry by itself also works, but not together
